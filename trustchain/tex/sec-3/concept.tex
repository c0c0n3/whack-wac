\subsection{Concept and Objectives}

The past two decades have witnessed the rise of online, user-centred
services, most notably social media, which has resulted in a staggering
amount of user-generated content being produced and stored online.
However, individuals have seldom retained true ownership and control
of their own online data. Instead, few large corporations have been
amassing disproportionate amounts of user data, leaving individuals
with little to no control over how their data are shared, augmented
and processed to generate revenue. This state of affairs has raised
serious concerns about online data, ranging from the manifest, such
as security and privacy, to the subtle and hotly debated ethical and
social implications.\cite{stremlau2018world}

Can individuals regain control of their own online data? Although
it appears to be a problem of gargantuan proportions, online data
privacy and security can be and must be improved. Indeed, the inventor
of the Web himself, Tim Berners-Lee, has embarked on a journey to
address this very problem with the Solid project\cite{sambra2016solid}%
(https://solidproject.org/) under the auspices of the W3C. Solid aims
to repair the Web by enabling true data ownership and strengthened
privacy through distributed, decentralised applications controlled
by individuals rather than large corporations.

We intend to contribute to the Solid journey by improving and extending
Web Access Control (WAC), a core component of Solid's privacy and
security architecture. We believe that for individuals to truly regain
control of their online data in a decentralised architecture, strong
correctness guarantees are needed about the software implementing the
WAC specification.
