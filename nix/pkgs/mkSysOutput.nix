# NOTE
# ----
# 1. Could use Haskell env from Nixie. Bring it in if really needed
# though, since it comes with lots of packages.
# 2. Adding extra Tex packages. The Nixie default env comes with the
# most used ones, but we can easily add more if need be. See
# - https://github.com/c0c0n3/nixie/wiki/Texie
